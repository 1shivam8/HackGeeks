Project description =>Our project is Sign language translator.Sign language is a visual language that is used by deaf and dumb people as their mother tongue. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluidly convey the thoughts of a person. It is achieved by simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions. It can be used by a person who has difficulties in speaking or by a person who can hear but could not speak and by normal people to communicate with hearing disabled people. 
Indian Sign Language is used by deaf, dumb and hard of hearing people for communication by showing signs using different parts of body. All around the world there are different communities of deaf and dumb people and thus the language of these communities will be different.
